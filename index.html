            <h2>The System</h2>
            <div class="system-explanation">
                <p><strong>Here's the thing:</strong> everyone uses letter grades, stars, X/10, etc., to rate movies. It's boring, too easily understood by readers, and doesn't allow for a holistic view of the total impact movies have on a person's life. I don't respect it.</p>
        
                <p>Instead, I use a "quality of life" scoring system that ranges from -1 to 2. I only use integers—no 1.3 or -0.8—because I'm not a coward, and I commit to my ratings.</p>
        
                <p>Why do I use this apparently random, offset scale? Because I score movies based on the impact they had on my life. If the movie made my life better for that 90+ minutes, it's a 1. If I was miserable from title to credits, it's a -1.</p>
        
                <p>Thus, the "net score" you'll see on this site is a reflection of how movies have made my life better or worse over the year. The scale is offset because I'm an optimist and believe that a truly great movie, like <em>BlackBerry</em>, has twice the positive impact on a person as an awful movie like <em>Space Jam: A New Legacy</em>.</p>
        
                <p>Enjoy.</p>
